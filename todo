instrument:
	check if the eccessed memory is in one of the block (if not return)
	if the entry exist increment counter else create entry (1 for read and 1 for write)

and on exit compute data to recover struct (first considère one access  = one member)
after:
	heuritics to avoid memset/memcopy like false positive
	detect tab
	detect tab of struct
	detect ptr
	detect ptr type
	generate an html (or equivalant to bottlepy ?) page with schéma for struct recover
	add alloc/free fonction when hoover
	add read/write access by founction when hoover

bonus:
	detect signedness


recover cpp class : same tool or standalone ?
