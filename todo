for each bb block event
for each instr
if instr is read and memory reference : instrument (c clean call first we look at opti after)
if instr is write and memory reference : instrument (c clean call first we look at opti after)

use drutil_expand_rep_string to transform advanced str instruction in a loop to make the analyse easier

and on exit compute data to recover struct (first considère one access  = one member)
after:
	heuritics to avoid memset/memcopy like false positive
	detect tab
	detect tab of struct
	detect ptr
	detect ptr type
	generate an html (or equivalant to bottlepy ?) page with schéma for struct recover
	add alloc/free fonction when hoover
	add read/write access by founction when hoover

bonus:
	detect signedness


recover cpp class : same tool or standalone ?
